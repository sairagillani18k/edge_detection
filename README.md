# Monitoring and Health Assessment of Electricity Wires with Edge Detection

Edge detection is a crucial technique in computer vision for finding boundaries of objects within an image. The technique involves pinpointing areas of rapid change in the color and intensity of the pixels in an image. In this way, boundaries are identified where objects meet the image background. One significant application of edge detection is locating electricity wires in urban landscapes, and assessing their trajectories and health.

By integrating edge detection with predictive analytics, it becomes possible to forecast potential issues based on patterns and trends.Â 
For instance, if a wire's edge shape is deviating from its norm, it might indicate an underlying problem. A straight line can be drawn representing the original or ideal wire trajectory between two points. Then the detected wire can be superposed on top of it to measure how much it has sagged. If it sags below a set threshold, an alert can be issued to signal the requirement for maintenance. This is demonstrated in the image below.
